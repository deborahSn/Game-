# FightingGame
Project carried out for my studies, in command line with Xcode.
It's a fighting game between two players and with two teams of three characters.
To win the game, the characters on the team must stay alive the longest.
On each turn, the player can choose an attack function on the opposing team or a healing function on one of his characters.
